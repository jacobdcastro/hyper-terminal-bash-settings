# hyper-terminal-bash-settings
This is a default config file to allow Hyper users to use Git Bash (even on Windows). This config is specifically for the Hyper Terminal! If you don't have it, you can [download Hyper here](https://hyper.is/)! 

_Note_: You must have Git installed on your machine! If you do not, you can [install Git here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Setting Terminal to Bash

1. Copy entire `config.js` file found in this repo to your clipboard.

2. Open Hyper Terminal.

3. Click the upper-left hamburger icon to open settings menu. Then go to Edit > Preferences. Or use the preferences shortcut `ctrl+comma`. This should open a text editor with the current Hyper configuration.

4. Select all current file contents with `ctrl-a` and then paste what you copied from step 1.

5. Restart Hyper Terminal and Bash should now be the active shell!
